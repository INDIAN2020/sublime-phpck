PHP Completions
===============

Congratulation! You have installed support for PHP ~5.6 completions.

Remember, to avoid duplicate and unexpected completions disable the default
completions bundled with Sublime Text.

One way to disable the bundled completions is to override them:

1. Locate the `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
2. Create a directory named `PHP`
3. Create an empty file named `PHP.sublime-completions` inside the `PHP` directory

Issue reports and pull requests are always welcome.
